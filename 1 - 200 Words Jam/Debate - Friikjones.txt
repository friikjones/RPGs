Gather at least 2 friends, and a stopwatch.

Two players are opposing politicians, the rest are voters.
Make up names for their parties, a motto and a color.

Write down "THE SUN IS DEAD".
Both politicians have to debate as it was true, while the voters know for a fact that is not.

One politician starts asking a question, the other one answers, the first one replies and the other one rejoinders.

Use the stopwatch to enforce a maximum time limit for each monologue.
Disruptions will not be tolerated. If there are enough people, we recommend one voter be appointed host of the debate.

One by one, the voters write down a outlandish concept of any kind, which will be the next topic.

After all topics are debated, the voters cast their vote in secret.

The winning politician keeps his place in the debate, and is now running for re-election. If he chooses, he can appoint a proxy to run for him.
One of the voters replace the losing politician, with a new party, motto and color.

The game ends when everyone is sick and tired of democracy, or the debate gets too real.
