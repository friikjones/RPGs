You are a Firehawke, tasked by the Mothers to seek the Books which have kept the colony alive since the Sun died a hundred years past. As the words from your Book fade, so does its Heat. Find the Libraries. Find the Books. Heat is life.

Pick six tags, each a brief phrase that describe your best aspects. You have seven HEAT. 

Take all Aces, twos, threes, fours, and tens from a deck of cards to form a Test Deck. To make a test, add the number of tags that apply to the test, up to a max of three. Draw that number of cards from the Test Deck. If any card you draw is an Ace, you succeed. If you do not draw an Ace or a ten, you either fail or succeed with a complication (player’s choice). If you draw a ten, you lose one HEAT and if you did not also draw an Ace, you either fail or succeed with a complication (GM’s choice). Do not reshuffle the deck after a test UNLESS you draw a ten.

If a test fails, any player may spend one HEAT to allow you to draw another card.
