One GM, 2+ players. You are stranded in a dark place. One of you will not escape. You need to leave. Blindfolds optional.

GM:
Create and describe a fitting scenario.
Write down a list of faults that brought the characters where they are, and randomly hand them out mixed with blank papers.
Create 5 problematic situations (Complications) to be solved by the players. Each Complication, stemming from a Fault, is assigned a Difficulty Level (DL) unknown to the players and determining the amount of effort required to solve it.
Failing to solve 3+ Complications will result in an unsuccessful escape and untimely deaths.

GAMEPLAY:
Complications are introduced one at a time.
Since they have useful details, the player with the associated Fault can reveal it decreasing the DL by 1.
Any number of characters may then volunteer to solve the Complication. If they equal or exceed DL they succeed.
The GM narrates whether the complication is solved and its consequences, then gives permanent Maluses to each volunteer. Maluses can be any form of impediment (stress, injury, fatigue...).

After the final complication is solved, characters will have to vote for one of them to be left behind in their escape.
