# Wakaatu's Lair
The legendary beast know as *Wakaatu* has been in the Cholula Tribe folklore since time immemorial. Tales say of a beast that mastered up and down, heaven and earth. It can soar high and dig deep equally fast. It can melt flesh in one single breath.

It is not evil nor good, it is a wise beast, and should be treated with both respect and fear.
