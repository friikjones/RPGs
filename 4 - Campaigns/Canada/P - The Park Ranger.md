# P - The Park Ranger

Adventurers / Mercenaries / Firefighters needed!

There has been an unusual amount of forest fires in Wicked Oak Woodlands in the last months, and the Ranger Department believes that they are both intentional and criminal in nature.

We suspect that the perpetrators are living in the Woodlands, are organized and able to defend themselves, as there has been murder of possible witnesses in the area.

Report to the Head of the Ranger Department of Wicked Oak Woodlands for further briefing and immediate hiring.

Payment: 75gp plus expenses
Expected Time: 3 to 4 days

Signed,
  Smokey Oakfuur, Head Ranger of the Wicked Oak Woodlands Reserve.
