GM - The Abandonned Mine
========================

## Who is Willburn
Laurence Willburn is a tall Dwarf, with a full red beard to his waist.
He's 1.40m, 70kgs, and smell like sweet ale.
Hearthy laugh and personality, becomes very serious when the subject asks for it.
Wears simple soldier attire, chain mail and a large axe to his back, with a Sheriff pin in his chest.

## The ones behind it
A powerful wizard by the name of Zedus Blackcape was feed the (wrong) info that there's deposits of rare magic minerals in Old Twin Springs Mine at Naked Peak.
He found a old, abandoned mining common hall, and made a ritual to conjure a Spectator to protect it, making his base of operations.
He also summoned oozes to slowly break the rock, but they started overflowing.
