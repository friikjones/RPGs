GM - The Park Ranger
========================

## Who is Smokey
  Smokey is a brown, large Awakened Bear. He's a very peaceful and chill guy.
  He's about 300kgs, 3.20m tall when standing up and 1.70m on all fours.
  He has manners, is very polite and stands up to talk to people, but like to go about his day on all fours.
  He wears a hat with large brims, red handkerchief around with neck and a belt, but no pants.

## The ones behind it
  A powerful wizard by the name of Zedus Blackcape was feed the (wrong) info that there's deposits of rare magic minerals below the Wicked Oak Woodlands Reserve.
  He found a old, abandoned outpost, and made a ritual to conjure a Spectator to protect it, making his base of operations.
  Then, he hired a clan of Bugbears, called Klert-Voracs (Fear-Flag) to burn down the forest, as to be able to destroy the reserve and buy the land.

  Bugbears speak Ghukliak, and just shout at each other and players. There's no way to reason with them.

  The Spectator is called Phud'gha. He speaks through telepathy, and refers to himself in the third person.
  He is courteous, but keen in killing anyone who is not allowed in the outpost.
