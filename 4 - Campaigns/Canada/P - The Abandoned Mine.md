# P - The Abandoned Mine

Adventurers / Mercenaries / Miners needed!

Strange sounds and smells have been reported coming from the Old Twin Springs Mine at Naked Peak. There's been also talk about livestock vanishing in the field next to the mine entrance.

Recently, some strange acid ooze has started sipping from the side of the mountain, and we believe that it is caused by whatever is living in the mines. We sent a search party of officers and villagers, but none came back.

If you have the guts to go inside the mine and figure out what is happening, the reward would be handsome. Please help us, we are over our heads in this one.

Payment: At least 50gp
Expected Time: 1 evening

Signed,
Laurence Willburn, Sheriff of Naked Peak Village.
