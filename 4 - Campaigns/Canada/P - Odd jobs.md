========================

1 - Protection Money

	Hi, this is Anthony Demoke, I'm the proud owner of Demoke's Smoked's.
	I have reason to believe that the nice fellow that asked me for protection money was not from the Baron, but from the local Mafia.
	I *really* would not like to pay taxes twice. Is there any gentleman how would like to check  this situation for me? Thank you.
	
	Payment: 25gp
	Expected Time: Should be quick
	
	
2 - The Earie Presence

	Norman Alebrew here, keep resident brewer. We have a problem.
	There's been theft in the keep's liquor room. The problem is, as far as I can tell, the thief can walk through walls. Also, he might be invisible. Also, he's very loud. And maybe dead. Help.
	
	Payment: 25gp and all the booze you can drink in a sitting.
	Expected Time: 1 day? I don't know, I'm not a psychic.
	
3 - The Devil's Crop

	My name is Percival Cricket, fourth generation farmer, proud villager and community member.
	This is the deal: Our crops are coming to get us. For real.
	Recently, humanoids made out of our crops (talk about insult to injury) are attacking our village, our farms and our livestock. We are a couple strong, but not enough for the hordes of living vegetables.
	Help is apreciated, ASAP.
	
	Payment: 100gp
	Expected Time: As long as it takes, but be quick.
	Expected Crew: 4 Strong adventurers.
