		Suspect is armed and dangerous, proceed with caution. Last seen around the black forest north of the city of Newham
		Witness description:
			Meat golem, pg 177 manual do monstro
		Reward: 150gp

## What it is
	The creature is a Flesh Golem, bound by a powerful sorcerer to protect a important shrine in the black forest
	The shrine holds a valuable item, a fist size ruby, engraved with powerful, mind altering magic.
	At some point in the last weeks or so, a tree fell on top of one of the walls, which collapse on top of the golem's focus, which in turn, made the golem's control wobbly, making it attack the nearby road sometimes.
	It still holds the shrine as home and defends it.

## The Black forest
	The Golem leaves a discernible track next to the road, that can be tracked towards the center of the forest.
	The journey in is roughly 3 days long, with 1 test every 3h:
		- CD 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
	Every failed test can be corrected by a CD +2 test, or lose 2h to get back to where they were. 
	Players can track in the dark for a -2 penalty to tests.
	Every night they can get attacked by random ND 2 encounter 

### The Encounter
	If they pass the last test with a 16 or more, or they pass a CD 10 stealth check, they see the Golem without being seen.
	If the players destroy what remains of the focus, the golem breaks free of the sorcerer's control and goes on a blind rampage against the players, but can go through em if they move out of the way.

### The Engraved Ruby
	The Ruby is engraved with mind altering magic, having the following effect on intelligent creatures:
	Anyone that looks directly at it rolls a WIS saving throw against CD 7, or gets mesmerized by it.
	Anyone that tries to read the engravings rolls a WIS saving throw against CD 12, or loses itself in its gaze for 1d6 hours or until loses line of sight.
	Anyone that studies it for 2h rolls a WIS saving throw against CD 14. On a fail, roll a d20:
		- 6 or more the creature suffers a short term madness (dungeon master guide pg 261). 
		- 5 or lower, gets charmed and becomes obsessed for studying the ruby.
	3 fails or more makes the short term madness into medium term madness

### The plan B
	The mages at the tower have the knowledge and wisdom to pinpoint the flesh golem and provide the proper knowledge in how to kill it, while the blacksmiths on the city have the tools to make the weapons needed
