# Session 2

On their return, they are greeted by guardsmen on the city gates, and instructed to go to Nicolin's quarters at the Grounds
Nicolin will get angry when he learns they didn't catch the monster, and without pay immediately.

If they explain it was a monster, he will ask for proof. If they say it is magical, he will direct them to the Council Tower, to talk to Greater Mage Caspian of Whiteshore
He'll say he'll study the gem, and ask for a week. In the meantime, they can train/purchase stuff, which gives lvl up.

All the while, I keep making perception checks Vs their highest passive perception, if I pass by less than 2, they get suspicious.

They learn about how this could be part of a specific ritual, making the gem a part of a set of 5 gems, that could be near.
They can talk to Nicolin about leads, and get the following:

## The Abandoned Mine:
Strange sounds and smells have been reported coming from the Old Twin Springs Mine at Naked Peak. There's been also talk about livestock vanishing in the field next to the mine entrance.
Recently, some strange acid ooze has started sipping from the side of the mountain, and we believe that it is caused by whatever is living in the mines. We sent a search party of officers and villagers, but none came back.

## The Forest Fires:
There has been an unusual amount of forest fires in Wicked Oak Woodlands in the last months, and the Ranger Department believes that they are both intentional and criminal in nature.
