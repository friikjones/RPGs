GM - The Park Ranger
========================

## The ones behind it
The Green gem is hidden withing the Wicked Oak Woodlands Reserve on an abandoned outpost.
The sorcerer made a ritual to conjure a Spectator to protect it the gem.
Then, he hired a clan of Bugbears, called Klert-Voracs (Fear-Flag) to burn down the forest, as to be able to destroy the reserve and buy the land.

Bugbears speak Ghukliak, and just shout at each other and players. There's no way to reason with them.

The Spectator is called Phud'gha. He speaks through telepathy, and refers to himself in the third person.
He is courteous, but keen in killing anyone who is not allowed in the outpost.
